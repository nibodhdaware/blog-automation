# Automating my Blog writing process

this is a fun little side project of me trying to automate my blog writing process

# Idea

I was once writing a post on Hashnode and to post the same post on Dev.to I had to copy paste everything on hashnode and post to Dev.

That's just redendunt work so I thought so I made this side project for automating that process.

# Usage

clone this repository

```
git clone https://github.com/nibodhdaware/blog-automation
```

create a `.env` file and put the API key from Dev.to.

```
DEV_TO_API_KEY=KEY_GOES_HERE
```

run `npm install` to add all the missing packages on your machine.

then run `nodemon app.js` to run the server
